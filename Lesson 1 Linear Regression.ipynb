    "Linear **regression** is a machine learning technique that is part of the **supervised** category. This category requires labeled data, which means the data set used to train a model contains examples the model can learn from. Typically labeled data is historical in nature where the answers are already known. Our goal is to use this historical knowledge and create a model that can accurately predict what the label will be for data the model hasn't seen before."

    "In a data set used for supervised learning, there are **independent variables** that we hope will do a relatively good job at predicting our labeled **dependent variable**. A regression problem focuses on predicting a numerical value that could exist anywhere along the spectrum (i.e. numbers with precise decimals). Futher, a linear regression assumes a linear relationship (as opposed to a non-linear relationship) between the independent and dependent variables, which determines the type of math used behind the scenes.\n",
